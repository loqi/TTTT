## The TTTT agent

The agent is the unit of automation. There may be clients running on smartphones and servers running in the cloud, but ultimately that is a convenient fiction. Anything that happens in TTTT is performed by agent peers. This is the process software that initiates TTTT directives and responds to the directives of others.

TTTT is the root protocol for managing fundamental Transitive Trust Topology relationships, as well as any extensions to the protocol suite. Each peer in the graph directly sees a one-degree distance horizon. Any graph structure beyond that horizon must be inferred from behavior. The TTTT protocol has two basic responsibilities:

    1. Establish and maintain basic TTT infrastructure links
    2. Accepting "clade" modlules extending TTTT for application support

### Setting up development environment for open-source contribution
    Do this in a terminal:
        > python3 -m venv venv
    This creates and initializes a virtual environment named 'venv'
    Verify there is now a directory './venv' ready with a new virtual environment.

    Now pointing your development tool (IDE, etc.) to './venv/bin/python' or some specific version found in ./venv/bin directory.

    Next, enable the virtual environment in your terminal command line session:
        > source venv/bin/activate
    Your command line may have a prepended indicator of the virtual environment name (venv) as
    a reminder that your session is now operating within this virtual environment.

    Now you will be able to install the packages used in TTTT development without affecting your
    non-TTTT configuration.
