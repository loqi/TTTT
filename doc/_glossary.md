# Glossary

**3milmo** -- "third millennium money" -- A clade module extending TTTT to support a currency application mediated by fungible IOUs. This is meant to give the power of fiat currency to everybody, not just the few. In this system, one does not earn money before spending it; one spends money before earning it. Yeah, it works better than it sounds.

**agent** -- The active peer process running (this software) on a TTT node. An agent is empowered to act autonomously in some capacities that require speed to perform or that are not worth the human attention of the owner of the node. Sometimes an agent defers a decision to its owner. (A node is a place. An agent is a bot. An owner is a person.)

**ding** -- A clade module extending TTTT to support a messaging and heralding application assigning reliable urgency ratings meaningful to the recipient. This is meant to rescue us from being human packet routers by quieting the arrival of most messages and emphasizing the few that really matter to us, the recipient.

**directive** -- A TTTT 'verb' initiated by one agent and solicited to another agent for action.

**dunbar** -- An owner or an agent or a node connected to another in direct TTT link. From your perspective, you own a node with a collection of links with each of your dunbars. Your dunbar nodes should belong to owners personally known to you, to the extent that you are willing to trust them at least a little bit with an aspect of at least one TTTT application.

**link** -- A direct connection between a pair of dunbars on the TTT.

**node** -- An individual vertex in the TTT graph. A node is not an agent, but is a topological location on the graph, while an agent is a software process responsible for interacting with other agents via protocol directives. (A node is a place. An agent is a bot. An owner is a person.)

**owner** -- The human or other entity of authority controlling any particular TTT node. An agent is operated by an owner, and an agent resides at a node. (A node is a place. An agent is a bot. An owner is a person.)

**stranger** -- An owner or an agent or a node not in direct TTT link. Anyone who is not a dunbar.

**TTT** -- Transitive Trust Topology -- The graph of peers serving as the infrastructural primitive network

**TTTT** -- Transitive Trust Topology Tinker (a.k.a. "tabletop") -- The root protocol for establishing and maintaining the TTT network. Also, the suite of application clade modules that extend functionality to support many TTT applications.

**yarn code** -- A short string of characters used to associate asynchronous replies as part of an ongoing TTTT protocol back-and-forth algorithmic conversation.
