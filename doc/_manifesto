 The Transitive Trust Topology Tunneler protocol and associated applications allows us to see the global Internet (or any internet) as a graph of nodes connected in a transitive-trust topology. The global Internet is a graph (network) of hosts linked along dynamically adaptive hardware and software routers into a global topology correlating to conveniently deployed communication links. That graph serves the need of getting arbitrary data from one device to some distant device by any means that gets that job done. We can think of the Internet as a *pysical graph* that is good at naively moving data around.

A TTTT network is a *logical graph* of nodes (individually addressable devices and their semi-automated software agents) that uses the physical graph of the Internet to transfer data, and further imposes symantic meaning to the TTTT logical routing connections *(dunbar tunnels)* by modeling actual levels of trust within real human relationships. In this sense, a TTTT arena is technically a form of "social media," but a form of social media far different from the dysfunctional forms we are familiar with. Centralized social media is owned by individuals or other priveleged entities exerting arbitrary control and issuing "community" guidelines for users to live by. They are about as vibrant a community as a feudal fifedom or totalitarian state.

By contrast, a TTTT arena is a decentralized network of peers. Everyone is free to sabotage or nurture their own local ambit of the arena without affecting the functionality of others along routes beyond our reach.

Just as an original promise of the Internet was to treat censorship as damage and route around it, a TTTT arena treats anti- or pro-social activities as a form of foolish self-sabotage or rooted relationship building, by weakening or strengthening trust links between nodes in proportion to our actual trust in our actual relationships. Those who bring value to the lives of others rapidly gain network reach, both deep and far in the arena. Likewise, bringing harm to someone provides immediate feedback in the form of more expensive or less available access to the agrieved individual, and by implication, to the arena at large. However, that works both ways. If for example, someone suffers under the misaprehension that unpleasant feelings are a reliable proxy for actual harm, that person is free to self-sabotage. We are all despots within our ambit. We cannot punish someone without limiting ourselves. If we mis-identify good stuff as bad stuff, we "protect ourselves" from that good stuff, while the world continues on without our full participation. We can live our lives according to our values, and live in the consequences.

**Nodes are disposable; tunnels are valuable**

A durable link between two nodes with any measure of trust between them is called a tunnel. Node pairs at each end of such a tunnel are said to be in a dunbar relationship, or simply, are dunbars of one another. In order to gather significant reach in the TTTT arena, the actual relationship between human owners of dunbars must be cultivated in the real world. Only a fool or a person of great fortitude would formally quantify their trust level with a dunbar significantly higher than their real-world human relationship is valued by their human counterparty.

A reasonable novice strategy for recording formalized trust in a dunbar is to set the trust level a tiny bit higher than the human owner of that node seems to value their direct access to you. The advantage of understating your level of trust in someone is you are safer from large-scale betrayal. The advantage of slightly overstating your trust in someone is you invite both small-scale betrayal *and* rapidly-building trust through a series of small and growing mutually beneficial interactions. Feeling our way toward an optimal balance between vulnerability and opportunity is one of the central challenges faced by all of us wanting a life well lived.

**Do not expect perfection; strive for gradual improvement**

Betrayal will find you. Loyalty will find you. People change. You change. Relationships shift and it's a rare person who explicitly tells you when you have lost some of their trust. Over time, with judicious clutivation of your ambit, you will gradually find yourself surrounded by ever more valuable opportunities mixed in with ever-shrinking proximate hazards.

We are free to attrophy or flourish on the strength of our own judgment, flaws and all. We are free to eventually learn the difference between pain and harm, between pleasure and benefit -- or not -- and live our lives accordingly without interfering with the adventures, risk-taking, disasters, and successes of others.
