# TTTT:ding
## human alert metadata

A human-addressed message's initiator may accurately estimate and declare the urgency (or much more often, the vapidity) of a message. The ding protocol provides a TTTT mechanism for any message or phone call or calendar change or visit or physical delivery through any medium to be heralded in advance by an appropriate level of alert in proportion to the sender's estimated level of importance from the perspective of the recipient. There is accountability built in, so if a message urgency has been inaccurately rated -- in the opinion of the recipient -- it is in the interest of the sender to adjust their behavior going forward or risk waning access to the trust network.
