Here is some useful terminology:

'TTT' transitive trust topology is the graph of trust. An agent cannot directly see beyond its dunbars.
'TTTT' transitive trust topology tinker (or "tabletop") is the protocol of the TTT graph
'clade' extends TTTT with specific talents, i.e. 3milmo (credit money), ding (message ratings)
'node' is a locus on the TTT graph (a virtual place)
'agent' is a software process that speaks TTTT (a daemon) on the TTT graph
'agent zero' is the first-person agent residing at the local node
'owner' is the person or similar entity who controls an agent
'dunbar' is an agent at an adjacent TTT node, one where there's a little trust
'stranger' is any TTT agent without sufficient trust to link directly as a dunbar
