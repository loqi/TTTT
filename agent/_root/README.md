# TTTT - Transitive Trust Topology Tinker

This is the root protocol for managing fundamental Transitive Trust Topology relationships. Each peer in the graph directly sees a one-degree distance horizon. Any graph structure beyond that horizon must be surmised. The TTTT protocol has two basic responsibilities:

    1. Establishing and maintaining basic TTT infrastructure links
    2. Accepting "clade" modlules extending TTTT for application functionality
